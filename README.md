I installed the necessary libraries and loaded the dataset from a .csv file. I summarized the data, examining variable types and the number of rows and columns. Categorical variables were converted to factors, and numeric variables to numeric format. Missing values in the bmi variable were imputed using the mean. To address class imbalance in the stroke variable, I applied the SMOTE algorithm. The data was then split into 70% training and 30% test sets. Using the caret package, I trained rpart, knn, svmRadial, rf, and nnet models on the training set with 5-fold cross-validation, comparing accuracy and kappa values. The random forest model achieved the highest accuracy (0.9831) and kappa (0.9662). This model was then used on the test set, yielding an accuracy of 99.11%, sensitivity of 98.22%, and specificity of 100%.
